My analysis shows that the longer a person working at DETE/TAFE, the higher chance this worker will resigned from the organisation due to dissatisfaction. The number of resignation due to dissatisfaction also increase with employee's age. Resignation due to dissatisfaction is a general term for several resignation reason:
- Job dissatisfaction 
- Dissatisfaction with the department             
- Physical work environment dissatisfaction 
- Lack of recognition 
- Lack of job security
- Work location
- Employment conditions
- Work life balance
- Workload
