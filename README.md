Analyze relationship between employee's resignation reason and working experience 
 
Link to Jupyter Notebook: [notebook](Basics.ipynb)

My analysis shows that the longer a person working at DETE/TAFE, the higher chance this worker will resigned from the organisation due to dissatisfaction, including:
- Workload dissatisfaction                
- Physical work environment dissatisfaction 
- Lack of recognition 
- Lack of job security
